Supreme Court Citation Network DataDeveloped byJames H. FowlerUniversity of California, San DiegoandSangick Jeon, Stanfordemail: jhfowler@ucsd.eduThis page contains links to data on citations in the U.S. Supreme Court from the U.S. Reports for 1754 to 2002. We have spent a lot of time developing this data so if you want to use it please cite the following paper:    * The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent: A Network Analysis, James H. Fowler and Sangick Jeon Social Networks forthcoming      (mentioned in The Economist) This paper describes basic features of the data and how it was retrieved and processed. Because it is a very large data set there will inevitably be some mistakes in it.For a related paper using a different data set, please see:    * Network Analysis and the Law: Measuring the Legal Importance of Supreme Court Precedents, James H. Fowler, Timothy R. Johnson, James F. Spriggs II, Sangick Jeon, and Paul J. Wahlbeck, Political Analysis, forthcoming DATA FILESA zipped copy of all files is available here.    * The judicial.csv file is an aggregate results file. It is comma delimited and here's a quick key:      caseid 	unique numerical id given to each case      usid	US Reporter id (or numerical equivalent for early Reporters)      parties	parties to case      overruled	if case was overruled, the caseid of the overruling case is shown      overruling   	if case overruled other case(s), the overruled caseids are shown      oxford	Does case appear on Oxford list of salient cases?      liihc	Does case appear on Legal Information Institute's list of important cases?      indeg	number of cases that cite this case (as of 2002)      outdeg	number of cases this case cites      hub	raw hub score (measures how well grounded the case is in the law)      hubrank	rank of hub score      auth	raw authority score      authrank	rank of authority score      between	betweeness measure      incent	eigenvector centrality measure
    * The allcites.txt file contains all citations. The first column indicates the caseid of the citing case and the second column indicates the caseid of the citedcase. The columns are space delimited. The next four files are all matrices of 30288 cases x 203 years (1800-2002). E.g. the element 5,10 is an observation for the case with caseid=5 in 1809.    * The indegmat.txt file identifies the inward citation count for each case in each year.
    * The outdegmat.txt file identifies the outward citation count for each case in each year. Notice that outward citations never change once a case comes into existence.
    * The authmat.txt file identifies the authority score for each case in each year.
    * The hubmat.txt file identifies the hub score for each case in each year. Notice that hub scores can change from year to year since the authority of cited precedents can change over time. Last Updated 15 May 2007Copyright © 1998-2007 James Fowler, All Rights Reserved.
